# VelocidroneQoL

This is a little mod made by me for increasing fov in velocidrone to infinite. i mostly use 145 because it feels way more confortable then stock 137 and doesnt look awfully huge.
Big shotout to LavaGang for making MelonLoader and sinai-dev for making UnityExplorer.
To increase fov just use left and right bracked as you normally do.

If you have any problems or sugestions, dm me on discord: xedoken

stay sideways and happy flying :)

   You want to click on Velocidrone.exe itself (dont click launcher.exe, go to app folder and you will find velocidrone.exe).
