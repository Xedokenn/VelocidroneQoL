# VelocidroneQoL

this is a little mod made by me for increasing fov in velocidrone to infinite. i mostly use 145 because it feels way more confortable then stock 137 and doesnt look awfull.
i used MelonLoader for importing the mod.
to increase fov just use left and right bracked as you normally do

if you want instructions of how to install and set it up dm me on discord: xedoken

stay sideways and happy flying
